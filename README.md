#Silicoin
<It's not silly if you make it with confidence ;)> xD

#### This is just a minimalistic cryptocurrency (currently working on it and still a proof of concept) built for learning purposes (blockchain, overlay networking, the holy golang).
#### Node functionality is not included in this repo because it's still buggy. Should you want to check that out, visit my [Personal](https://github.com/nderimx/Personal) repo.
